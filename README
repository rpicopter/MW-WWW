# mm-www 

This is web interface for MultiWii (MW).
It consists of two parts:
- the actual website
- proxy service that translates any requests from the website and sends them to MW service


Website
=======
The website is a simple WWW written in HTML + JS + PHP. It is build on top of Bootstrap (JS) and requires HTTP server with PHP5.

It allows the user to monitor, configure and control MultiWii board. The idea behind is that one can use it while in the field from a mobile device.

The website is dynamic (uses JS) to send any requests to the MW through WebSockets.


Installation:
- ensure you have got HTTP server with PHP5 installed and running
- ensure you have got the proxy service is running
- copy the WWW folder into your HTTP server


Proxy
=======
This is a service program designed to run on the host board. It is a link between MW service and the website. It uses WebSockets to communicate with the website. Any communication is then forwarded to MW service.

It is written in C and as such requires compilation.

Installation:
- get the proxy source code
- run './autogen.sh' (requires autotools and automake)
- run 'make' (this will create service executable 'mw-ws')
- run './ms-ws' 

You might want to schedule the run of 'mw-ws' on system startup.
